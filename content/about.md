<div class= "about-content" >
<p>

I'm a hard working, goal-driven, technology enthusiast native from [San Juan, PR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico). I'm currently a junior Computer Science major at the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame). Additionally, my passion for technology, innovation, and business has led me to pick up a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice.

In the fall of my sophomore year I learned how to program and fell in love with the creative power coding offers. I’m constantly learning and improving what I know. This thirst for knowledge ranges from <b>database administration</b>, <b>computer security</b>, and <b>web development</b> to <b>securities investing</b>, <b>financial wellbeing</b>, and <b>self improvement</b>.

My end goal is to go back to Puerto Rico and propel my community to a better place. I’m a person that will trace short term goals and work tirelessly towards achieving them. I’m also extremely <b>curious</b>, <b>outgoing</b>, and <b>social</b>. Additionally, I’ve been described as someone that often opts for an <b>objective</b> approach to resolving conflict as well as a person who <b>makes others feel included</b>.

I serve as a mentor to undergrads and find "joy in helping other people succeed". All of my project are open source and can be found in the GitHub link below. Feel free to reach out regarding any questions.

In addition, feel free to reach out with any learning or job opportunities. I’ve attached my LinkedeIn and email in the footer.
